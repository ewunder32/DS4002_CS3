# DS4002 Case Study - Predicting Palantir stock prices based on price history and keywords in the world news
This repository contains all code, documentation, and outputs for DS4002 Project 2, being used for the case study. We merge Palantir (PLTR) daily prices (9/30/2020–present) with GDELT GKG counts/tone of **AI- and war-related** keywords to forecast **5-day returns**. Models include ARIMAX and a Hybrid (ARIMAX + LSTM residuals), compared to a drift baseline and evaluated with a debiased long/flat backtest.

  -  The rubric outlines the formatting, submission requirements, and final deliverables for this assignment. Both documents should be referenced continously throughout your completion of the case study to guarantee success on the assignment.
- **DATA**
  - The image data can be obtained from FiveThirtyEight linked here. The Materials folder contains several images for various states, but there are more states to choose from on FiveThirtyEight. Additionally, you can find the declination angle (i.e., the numeric representation of the degree of partisan gerrymandering in a state) here, which you will use to verify the results of your image analysis.
