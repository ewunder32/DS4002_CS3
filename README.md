This repository contains all code, documentation, and outputs for DS4002 Project 2, being used for the case study. We merge Palantir (PLTR) daily prices (9/30/2020–present) with GDELT GKG counts/tone of **AI- and war-related** keywords to forecast **5-day returns**. Models include ARIMAX and a Hybrid (ARIMAX + LSTM residuals), compared to a drift baseline and evaluated with a debiased long/flat backtest.
